# ThreePartTransportation
The three-way university bus transportation system mainly solves the urgent demand in reality: bus transport companies need to arrange for the campus agents placed in the school every Monday to Thursday to collect cash at the designated places to collect cash and count the demand. In some special holidays, there may even be the problem of short supply or oversupply resulting in temporary cancellation of shifts, the root cause of which is that the customer's demand is uncertain, the agent cannot dynamically adjust the shift with the bus transport company, even if the adjustment is made, and the information cannot be transmitted to the teachers and students in a timely manner due to the limitation of time and space.  "Tripartite" refers to the consumer population, the bus transport company, the school tripartite.
